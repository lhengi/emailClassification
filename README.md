For question 4, I had two sperate files.

 4A, is nbayes4a.m
 4B, is nbayes4b.m

 both can just run with matlab.

 But 4B might take a bit longer to run, because it needs to retrain
 the data everytime alpha changes. Then at the end it will show two plots.
 
 4B: How does the change of alpha effect the classifier performance?
        According to the result and my plots, increasing alpha will make accuracy and f-score decrease.
